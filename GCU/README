Graph Cuts (GCU) partitions the vertices of a graph into two disjoint
subsets that are joined by at least one edge. It can be employed to 
efficiently solve a wide variety of low level computer vision problems,
such as image segmentation, stereo vision, image restoration. The maxflow
/ mincut algorithm to compute graph cuts is computationally expensive.
